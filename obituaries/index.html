death of Gareth Lewis. To those who were fortunate enough to have known
Gareth I'm sure you will feel as I do that the passing of a true
character somehow lessens us all. He really was unique and a person who
it was a pleasure and delight to spend time with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the
formative days of Oldham and Gt. Manchester Junior chess, he was the
driving force who enthused all of us around him. He made things happen
and got things done. He had little time for the bureaucracy and petty
politics that blights the chess world. Some of our older 3Cs members
will no doubt carry their own memories as they competed in one of his
teams. He had the ability to inspire players to play at the very best of
their abilities. My own son remembers with great fondness, Gareth's
fictional Aberystwyth Dragon opening especially invented by Gareth to
trap and ensnare the opposition. It worked too because he made everyone
believe in it. Gareth elevated the performance of the junior chess teams
of Oldham and Gt. Manchester to heights they have never since been able
to replicate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gareth B Lewis was a true son of Owain
Glyndwr. He loved his rugby, his chess and of course Dylan Thomas. His
teams entered the arena for combat with a passion only equalled at the
Arms Park. Whatever the sport or game he could generate a team spirit
that was tangible and everyone was prepared to give their all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gareth
had been blessed with the gift of storytelling. It didn't matter about
the accuracy or the plausibility he could weave a tale that had you
hooked into wanting to believe every word. Such were the spells the man
could cast. He personally taught me much as a young and inexperienced
headteacher. He took me under his wing and encouraged me constantly
throughout those formative years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was never a man who
you could lay claim to and hold as an inseparable friend as if he was a
treasured possession. His whole demeaner was unique and often shrouded
by a self created mystery as to his next venture. Life and time allowed
us to drift apart as it often does. Yet, with his passing I can only to
smile and recall how influential and special he was when I picture him
in full flow. It was a pleasure and unique experience Gareth to have
known you.</p></div><div><span class=" wz-bold"><br></span></div><div><span class=" wz-bold"><br></span></div><div><a href="/ManchesterChessV2/apps/blog/show/50238512-rip-stan-goodall-" id="D8AFFED7-FDEC-44BB-89DA-CCFEFA1D031A">RIP Stan Goodall.</a><span id=""></span></div><div><br></div><div>Stan played a significant role, for many

January 10th of Dave Monaghan, aged 74 and who had been one of the
stalwarts of the 3Cs' club since its very early years.</p><p> </p><p>Similar
to many of those who work behind the scenes at 3Cs, Dave's connection
with the club began when his son Karl started playing chess and then
himself took an interest in the game.</p><p>Not only did Dave enjoy
playing but also gained great satisfaction in taking a very active part
in coaching at the club and was the ideal person in explaining the
basics of the game to those who were just starting their own chess
career - many of whom eventually went on the achieve great success in
later years.</p><p>One of his proudest moments at the board was when the
great Russian Grandmaster David Bronstein visited 3Cs for a
simultaneous display in 1989 and Dave achieved a draw against him.</p><p>Steve
Rigby, founder and still main organiser of 3Cs, says it was a honour to
know Dave as his friend and that he was always a dignified person who
certainly encompassed the 3Cs' ethos of always ensuring the progress of
the children came first - and in that respect Dave had always shown a
very patient attitude in teaching the game of chess to the many
youngsters who had come under his wing at the club. <br></p><p><br></p><a id="79905AE1-AAC1-4154-AE1A-986809C2012F" href="/ManchesterChessV2/apps/blog/show/49692372-rip-neil-pickering-">RIP Neil Pickering.</a></div><div><p>Neil Pickering who was the Captain of Eccles Chess Club from 1998 - 2013</p><p>Neil

Peter Webster "Condolences to Tom and his family. He played for the
Greater Manchester team I captained in my gap year, and had the best
individual record that season. I remember him arriving breathless at a
venue in Worcestershire just before the default time and bashing out
1...Nc6 in response to 1 e4, and quickly getting a winning position".</p><p>Julian Farrand vs Harry Golombek British Chess Championships Bristol 1968&nbsp; <a id="D4715D98-4279-4F4B-A56F-BD5B655E90E8" href="https://share.chessbase.com/SharedGames/share/?p=XQOCrvPHBxI0VwiZf4Zxn6nvUciM9Mqbts3pMUMHtK2SbHNgISC7O6CYJLl6EHQe">https://share.chessbase.com/SharedGames/share/?p=XQOCrvPHBxI0VwiZf4Zxn6nvUciM9Mqbts3pMUMHtK2SbHNgISC7O6CYJLl6EHQe</a> Harry Golombek was a three times British chess champion 1947,1949,1955. <br></p><p>Julian Farrand winning for the England senior&nbsp; Team March 2020 <a id="FAF1ADCA-E372-4028-80E2-CE58C893EE59" href="https://share.chessbase.com/SharedGames/share/?p=XQOCrvPHBxI0VwiZf4Zxn496X/RrhP/4TRo05LrUzrcVVbUk8xIgo9K8Vjdi1ykV">https://share.chessbase.com/SharedGames/share/?p=XQOCrvPHBxI0VwiZf4Zxn496X/RrhP/4TRo05LrUzrcVVbUk8xIgo9K8Vjdi1ykV</a></p></div>

died peacefully&nbsp; at home, at 5 pm on 13th July.&nbsp; Having very recently
been diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus; he was 82; he is survived
by his wife Marjorie</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bernard was a member
when the club formed in 1956 having played chess at Bury Grammar, and
remained a member with only a break in the 1970s when his work as a Tax
Inspector took him away from Bury; as well as club President and
Committee Member, he was Press Secretary, former first team captain and
tournament controller, and also former Auditor of the Manchester Chess
Federation</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bernard was close to 200
strength at his peak, and remained a 150 grade player in his 80s,
testament to his underlying chess ability, and his determination and
mental sharpness</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’re not sure that the
club will survive without him, and we can’t imagine we will see his like
again; he always made an effort to welcome new players, young and old,
to the club, and encourage them whatever their ability</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More
importantly, Bernard was a gentleman, genuinely interested in others,
always happy to listen, put things into perspective, and give any help
that he could; he was patient and kind, honest, reliable and
trustworthy; everyone liked Bernard</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are all better for having known Bernard, and proud that he was our friend</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mick Norris, Treasurer Bury Chess Club</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Bert Thomas 15 July 1932 to 1 August 2017<br><br>Bert stepped in as General Secretary of the Manchester and District Chess Association at the turn of<br>the century, and was elected President in 2000; he served for a record 6 years in total, taking the<br>organisation through the merger with the Greater Manchester County Chess Association, and in the<br>process becoming the first President of the Manchester Chess Federation; he was later General<br>Secretary of the MCF from 2011 to 2015 and remained on MCF Council.<br>I will miss him; Manchester chess would not be the same without his wise counsel and hard work.<br>Bert was a key member of Urmston chess club, where in particular he filled the role of club<br>Treasurer; he was later instrumental in setting up and (re)forming Sale chess club, with considerable<br>success.<br>Bert was a gentleman, genial and polite, but with an inner determination that made him a<br>formidable negotiator; he used his non-chess skills excellently, and proved the adage that weaker<br>chess players can make brilliant chess administrators.<br>After his retirement, Bert and his wife Jeannie spent a few months a year in Florida, until her ill-<br>health confined them to the UK.<br>Away from chess, Bert had many interests and was involved with the Scout Association; the most<br>historical was that he was present on 6 May 1954 at Oxford&amp;#39;s Iffley Road athletics track when Roger<br>Bannister broke the 4 minute mile.<br>Bert joined the RAF after school, then went to Oxford to complete his education; he then became a<br>teacher, and moved round the south east as he progressed, before arriving in Manchester in the<br>mid-1970s; he became head of Sale Boys Grammar until it closed, and at his funeral, there were lots<br>of favourable mentions of his abilities.<br>He was also active in the Institute of Management; clearly, he brought his work and personal skills,<br>even temper, smile and great organisational abilities into chess; for which we should be eternally<br>grateful.<br>Bert had set up a Scout group in Woolwich when he was 27, and the 3 troops within it were so well<br>organised that they entered local scout competitions for 3 years during which they filled the first 3<br>places every time; Bert rose to a number of district commissioner roles in Manchester, and was<br>awarded the highest honour that Scouting offers.<br>Mick Norris, former MCF President; with kind assistance from Keith Johnston, former MCF President,<br>although any mistakes are mine!<br>25 September 2017<br></p></div>
